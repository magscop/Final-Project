         <h2 class="project-subtitle  reveal"> Project Overview<hr></h2>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Overview</h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">The idea for this mobile app design project came to me the night of a concert. I bought the tickets months in advance and was so excited to see one of my favourite artists, however, the excitement quickly turned into stress at the venue's entrance as I struggled to find the ticket in different apps and emails. This experience led me to propose a solution to my group members – a simple app to ease the process of accessing event tickets. When I shared the concept, they all related to similar struggles, confirming the widespread need for a straightforward solution to streamline ticket management for concert-goers.
<br> <br> 
                The decision to focus on Spotify specifically came later, as we realized the platform's crucial role in users' music and event experiences. This shift allowed us to integrate the ticket-saving feature directly into the Spotify app, aligning the project more closely with users' habits and preferences.</p>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Our Goal</h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">
                The primary goal of the project was to develop a user-friendly mobile application that simplified the process of accessing and managing event tickets, particularly for concert-goers. The aim was to eliminate the stress and inconvenience associated with searching through various apps and emails for tickets, providing users with a seamless and centralized solution. Additionally, the project sought to enhance the overall concert-going experience by integrating the ticket-saving feature directly into the Spotify app, aligning with users' preferences and habits. The ultimate objective was to contribute to user satisfaction, retention, and potentially enhance Spotify subscriptions, creating a comprehensive and compelling solution for both music and event needs.</p>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">Our successful integration of the ticket-saving feature into Spotify was guided by insights gathered through user interviews and testing. The high-fidelity prototype, shaped by user feedback, offered an intuitive and user-friendly solution providing a seamless solution for uploading and accessing tickets at any time.
<br> <br>
                By recognizing the significance of Spotify in the concert-goers' experience, our addition to the app addressed specific pain points, contributing to an improved user journey for Spotify's users. This collaboration not only enhanced our applications functionality but also played a pivotal role in refining the broader user experience within the Spotify ecosystem.</p>

            <p class="project-text  reveal">Through six focused twenty-minute Zoom interviews, we gathered qualitative insights by engaging users with targeted questions, eliciting real-time feedback and context-driven responses. To broaden our understanding, we deployed a Google Forms survey, crafted with key questions from interviews, allowing for feedback from a larger user pool.

                This dual-method approach facilitated a comprehensive view, enabling us to triangulate data for robust analysis. The combined insights from intimate interviews and broader surveys played a pivotal role in refining our product, ensuring it aligns with user experiences and preferences for a user-friendly end result. </p>

                Upon reviewing the feedback of our user interviews, it became obvious that the problem we were trying to solve was evident in everyone’s lives. 
                Almost all users stated that they have struggled to find their tickets before an event causing them so much stress it negatively affected their concert experience. 
                ​<br>
                <br>
                Other key insights:
                <br>
                1. Users genuinely like Spotify’s interface, user capabilities and user-friendly systems. 
                <br>
                2. Users purchase concert tickets months in advance and commonly lose track of their tickets in their email or camera roll.
                <br>
                3. Users commonly use Spotify to prepare for concerts and revisit to listen to music afterward.
                <br>
                4. Users like to use Apple Wallet but not every ticket can go into Apple Wallet.
                <br>
                5. Users like that when you are logged into Spotify on any device you stay logged in. </p>

                In the process of developing sketches and a low-fidelity prototype, I began by conducting a thorough analysis of the current website's information architecture.

The sketching phase involved creating rough paper sketches to explore different layout options and information hierarchies, prioritizing key elements based on user insights. Subsequently, these sketches were translated into a low-fidelity prototype using design tools, maintaining simplicity to focus on core structure and layout.</p>

                The existing website presents challenges with lengthy text passages, unengaging images, and an unclear card sorting system, contributing to difficulties for users in grasping FABSCRAP's mission and impact. 

 

                        FABSCRAPs current UI design makes the brand present as unapproachable and disorganized.
                        To address the current brand and the success of the organization, new brand voice characteristics were created to present the brand as empowering, innovative, community-centric and passionate.</p>

            <p class="project-text  reveal">
                Building on user feedback from the low-fidelity prototype, our mid-fidelity objectives focused on fixing navigation issues. We introduced new elements while testing out our UI style guide, including color scheme tests for better visual aesthetics. This integration ensured a cohesive design, enhancing the user experience and maintaining brand consistency. Subsequent testing showed fewer concerns about site architecture, however, increased attention & issues were raised on refining specific design elements.</p>

        <p class="project-text  reveal">
            To create the high-fidelity version, I built upon the insights gathered from the mid-fidelity phase. The primary focus remained on addressing any remaining usability issues and fine-tuning design elements. I implemented the finalized design based on the feedback received during the mid-fidelity testing, ensuring that the navigation was seamless, and design elements were visually appealing.
In the process of creating the high-fidelity version, I adopted an iterative approach by developing multiple versions. Each version incorporated slight variations in design, color schemes, and layout choices. This allowed for a comprehensive exploration of different design possibilities.
Subsequently, I conducted user testing on each of these multiple versions. This involved gathering feedback on the overall user experience, visual aesthetics, and any potential issues or preferences users might have had. By employing this iterative testing process, I aimed to identify the most effective design elements and address any remaining concerns.</p>
