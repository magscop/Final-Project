            Have you ever struggled to find cool places in a new city? How successful were you? How long did it take you to decide where to go? Was it easy to get there?
            <br> <br>
            After researching travel articles post-COVID-19, I noticed a flood of headlines filled with people eager to travel and an overwhelming array of recommendations and suggestions on what to do.
            <br> <br>
            <strong class="strong-2">When you type "what is the best way to travel and explore new cities" into Google, the first suggestion to show up is "talk to locals.” </strong> Locals provide the best insights into hidden gems, top recommendations, local transit, and the most authentic or trendy restaurants. They can help you travel on a budget by showing their top day-to-day places or the best high-end places they go for special occasions. 
            <br> <br>
            By connecting users with locals, we can make it easier for them to experience authentic culture and make the most out of their trip, which in a post-COVID-19 world is something that is yearned for. This insight inspired the idea for “Local”, a platform where real locals offer trustworthy recommendations.</p>

            <p class="project-text  reveal">User research was essential in developing the CoHive app, as it provided insights into the challenges individuals face in creative fields when building portfolios or securing jobs. I conducted four interviews with professionals from acting, playwriting, music, and advertising backgrounds. These interviews informed a survey completed by 14 respondents. Insights regarding project management, networking, confidentiality, and copyright emerged from this research. These findings helped identify the primary features of the app while also revealing the definition of success for a creative development app. </p>
