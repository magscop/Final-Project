                        Extra 360, previously known as Forefront Talent, is an innovative background organization streamlining the path for productions and aspiring background actors in the film industry. </p>

                          <p class="local">
                            
  Extra360 was facing a real challenge with their talent database. Every time the team needed to book actors for a production, they had to scroll through hundreds of photos to find the right fit. It was a tedious, time-consuming process that was slowing them down and creating a lot of frustration. On top of that, there was no single place to manage all their communications and production data, making everything feel disorganized and chaotic.
  <br><br>
  I could see how much this was holding them back, so I proposed a solution that would pull everything together in one place. I suggested creating a centralized database that would allow them to quickly search and find talent without the hassle of scrolling through endless images. Beyond that, I wanted to help them manage all their communications and production data from a single platform, giving them easy access to everything they needed. My goal was to make their workflow more efficient, freeing them up to focus on what they do best.

                          After designing the interal interface, Extra360 reached out because their website was facing similar issues. The site was confusing, generating too many user inquiries and ssers found the onboarding process frustrating, often abandoning the site before fully engaging with it. This led to an overwhelming number of support requests for the customer service team. In addition, their unclear brand identity made it difficult to connect with their target audience through marketing efforts.
                          <br><br>
Recognizing these challenges, I saw an opportunity to redesign their website and clarify their brand messaging.
<br><br>
By simplifying the onboarding process and creating a more defined brand identity, I could improve the user experience, reduce the volume of support inquiries, and make their marketing efforts more effective. This would streamline their operations and help them engage better with their audience.

                  To make managing productions smoother and more intuitive, I designed a main production dashboard tailored to Extra360’s daily needs. This dashboard became the hub for tracking active projects, organizing key contacts, and staying updated on performance metrics—all in one clear, easy-to-navigate space. By centralizing these essential tools, I aimed to give the production team instant access to everything they needed, helping them stay organized, minimize chaos, and focus on delivering high-quality work without the constant back-and-forth.</p>
